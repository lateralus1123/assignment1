My name is Dan. I'm interested in strategy games and mathematics.


PROGRAMMING BACKGROUND

My first foray into programming was with Java back in 2007. I took a course roughly equivlant
to CS161 for my first undergraduate degree. I also used a software package called MAPLE which
has a built in language for performing precise tasks. This software was designed for
mathematics.
