My name is Dan. I'm interested in strategy games and mathematics. I like spicy food and can't
operate in the morning without coffee.


PROGRAMMING BACKGROUND

My first foray into programming was with Java back in 2007. I took a course roughly equivlant
to CS161 for my first undergraduate degree. I also used a software package called MAPLE which
has a built in language for performing precise tasks. This software was designed for
mathematics. I also used Python to create a web app for an instructor who was teaching a
selected topics course. Since the course material was somewhat obscure, there were no such
apps readily available. This was my favorite programming project thus far since it was
so practical.
